## Usage

Used for creating notes and saving them to a list to be reviewed, edited or deleted when no longer needed

## Credits

I primarily used the information from class activities and MDN Developer for resources. Bootstrap and Font Awesome for style and design. Used uniqid npm for the random id generator

## Contributing

I worked on with one of my classmates

## Challenges

The main challenge that I was running into during this project was understanding the initial file and how to use the functions to save and delete the notes. Also finding out how to give each note a unique id and how to call to delete of make active
